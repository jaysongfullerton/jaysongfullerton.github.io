## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, part 1

  I really enjoyed this lab because we learned how to use command lines to create a sandwich of our liking. In this lab it taught me how to use command lines and versatile they could be. As soon as I got the hang of how command lines work it was really beneficial because we would use them later on in different labs.

* Lab 4, part 1 

  This was another one of my favorites because I love baking and have always been fond of the measurement system so being able to build this code so it can convert measurements to differnt measurements was very cool. It was also the first time we got the hang of how to really use functions and has helped me develop my skill of coding tremendously! As we alwasy use functions!

* Lab 10, part 1

  This was also my favorite because not only is the idea of neing able to create code about calculating a counties population so cool. But I really enjoyed using the combination of for loops and if statements in this code. Originally it was very challenging to me but after getting it down it doesn't leave your head!
